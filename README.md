# Whale Tracker Bot

Telegram bot for monitoring high-value activity across:

- Hyperliquid perp trades
- Polymarket trades
- Stake sports bets
- CoinGlass exchange OI anomalies (statistical detection)

The bot stores data in MongoDB, uses Redis for caching/deduplication, and sends alerts to dedicated Telegram channels (one per alert branch). It also supports manual Hyperliquid wallet tracking commands.

## Features

- Real-time ingestion from WebSocket/API feeds
- 4-branch Hyperliquid alert system:
  - **Fresh Wallet** — new wallets (≤50h) opening positions ≥$200K (excl. BTC/ETH)
  - **Whale Activity** — established wallets with positions ≥$300K (excl. BTC/ETH)
  - **Big Whale** — any position ≥$1M (all coins)
  - **Big TWAP** — spot buy/sell accumulation over a 3h window with cycles ≤45s apart; per-coin minimums (BTC ≥$19M, ETH ≥$8M, SOL/HYPE/BNB ≥$5M, XRP/DOGE ≥$4M). Only these coins alert; all other spot trades are still collected for analysis.
- Re-alerts when tracked positions grow +9% from last alert
- Hyperliquid manual tracking commands: `/track`, `/untrack`, `/tracked`, `/stats`
- Polymarket and Stake whale alerts
- CoinGlass OI anomaly detection (EWMA/CUSUM/MAD statistical methods, per-exchange)
- Optional Screenshots via Puppeteer

## Requirements

- Bun (runtime used by scripts)
- MongoDB
- Redis
- Telegram bot token
- Telegram channels/groups where the bot is an administrator
- OpenRouter API key for analysis/classification features
- CoinGlass API key (STARTUP plan, 30m OI history)

## Environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root.

## Run with Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up --build
